# Data-Robots Project 4: Predicting NBA Players' Salaries Using Stats <br/> 
<h2>Jaeik Park, Jared Roussel, Margaret Wharton & Nathan Haile</h2> <br/>

We are the Data Robots Sports Agency, an industry leader based in Atlanta, GA. We represent 450 NBA players and, arguably, our biggest responsibility is negotiating salaries on their behalf. We get a consultancy fee based on their salary, so it is obviously important to us to negotiate the best possible salaries for our clients. So, we decided to build some models to analyze the relationship between a player's stats and his salary for a given season. Using this information, we will be able to better predict salaries based on changes in our players' stats and be able to negotiate the best possbile salaries for them. <br/> <br/>
